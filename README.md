## OXSPENCE

**Decentralized file management and sharing dapp**

Basically, a "Decentralized Google Drive"

### Problem

The current and most popular file sharing and file management platforms are centralized and not censorship resistand. There have been many reports of these platforms suspending and deplatforming users, which has caused users to lose access to important files.

Also, Some of these platforms are not available in some regions and countries which leaves the potential users in those regions/countries at a disadvantage.

### Solution
The solution built is a decentralized file management/sharing system.

Oxspence allows user store documents in a secured manner, share files with friend or the public and collaborate on documents.

Users can access the platform from any region/country in the world without any fear of deplatforming or sale of information to third parties because the core and main features of the platform are smart contracts written and deployed to the blockchain network.



Some of the current features of OxSpence:

- Upload Files
